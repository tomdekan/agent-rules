# Python Code Style

- Fully typed Python. Never use `# type: ignore`.
- Use f-strings rather than other string formatting methods (e.g., `%`, `.format()`).
- Avoid local imports unless essential.

## Function Size

Each function should be small (less than 20 lines) and do one thing. Prefer many small functions over few large ones. This makes code easier to test, read, and maintain.

## Docstring Format

Use a newline after the opening triple quotes:

```python
def example_function(arg: str) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of what this function does.
    """
    return True
```
