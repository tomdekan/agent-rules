# Testing Guidelines

- Do not write tests that verify library/framework internals (e.g., Django's ManyToManyField behavior). Tests should cover custom business logic only.

## Why Manual Testing Matters

After adding new functionality, especially involving:
- Third-party API integrations
- Complex data processing pipelines
- Database model changes
- Background task handlers

Always run manual tests because:
- Unit tests mock external APIs - manual tests verify real integration
- Catches authentication issues, rate limits, API changes
- Validates data formats match between services
- Confirms end-to-end flow works with real data
