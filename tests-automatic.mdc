# Automated Testing Guidelines

- Do not write tests that verify library/framework internals (e.g., Django's ManyToManyField behavior). Tests should cover custom business logic only.
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested and the expected outcome.
- Keep tests focused on a single behavior or scenario per test function.
- Prefer testing behavior over implementation details.
- Use fixtures and factories for test data setup rather than hardcoding values.
