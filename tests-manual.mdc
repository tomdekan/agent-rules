# Manual Testing Guidelines

After adding new functionality, especially involving:
- Third-party API integrations
- Complex data processing pipelines
- Database model changes
- Background task handlers

Always run manual tests because:
- Unit tests mock external APIs - manual tests verify real integration
- Catches authentication issues, rate limits, API changes
- Validates data formats match between services
- Confirms end-to-end flow works with real data

## How to Test

- **Front-end work**: If browser access is available, take visual screenshots to verify changes. Check browser console for errors and network requests for expected behavior.
- **Back-end work**: Run code independently using Django shell, test scripts, or direct function calls. Verify inputs produce expected outputs and handle edge cases.
- **Focus**: Test isolated components that were changed first, then verify integration points if needed.
